# Basic Concepts

## What are Queries & Mutations
There are two basic operations in GraphQL schemas:

* **Queries**: 
Requesting data from a data model. An example Query would be: checking availability of hotels for a particular date and location

* **Mutations**: 
Making changes and carrying out transactions on data in the data model. An example Mutation would be: making a booking to reserve a hotel room on a particular date.

### Queries

Queries ask the system to provide some data, based on specfic parameters. This operation reads values from the server using a GraphQL Object and returns JSON text as a response.

Queries are interactive. You can use our API Playground to test your queries.

Our getting started guide shows you how to make queries to search for available hotels and get quotes.

### Mutations
Mutations are methods that change the data on the server. That is, mutations make a physical change to the data. This can include inserting a new object in a database, or deleting, or updating a data record.

Our getting started guide shows you how to make mutations to book and cancel services.
